# FoodForward üçΩÔ∏è


FoodForward aims to address the issue of food wastage in restaurants by creating a web application that facilitates the sharing and redistribution of surplus food. Restaurants often have excess food at the end of the day that goes to waste. Our platform allows restaurants to register and list their surplus food donations. Organizations dedicated to food redistribution are notified to collect and distribute the surplus food, reducing wastage and helping those in need.
